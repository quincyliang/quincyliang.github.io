## 1. Industry Know How

As an employee, your firs and foremost capability is **industry know how**, meaning that you have enough knowledge for this job,  market intelligence and industry networking. More importantly, you are able to keep up with the industry trend.

The biggest mistake for a company or an employee is not doing things wrong, but not doing the right things. Be careful and always ask am I heading in the right direction. For example, the strategy in marking industry 10 years ago is to shoot advertisement video by a super star. Nowadays, it is a totally different story. It turns to digital marketing and marketing campaign is switched to online social media and KOLs.

The lesson we learned from Nokia's case is that we need to keep us updated and be aware of the industry trend in the future. To improve ourselves, we can leverage the online courses.  



## 2. Ability to Manage Up

We need to manage our boss! 

**Align with your boss**. There are four big questions to ask:

- Do you know what is the goal of your boss?
- Do you know what "wins" your boss want?
- Are your priority and focus of your everyday work contribute to the goal of your boss?
- Do you share the same value as your boss?

Do not waste your time doing things meaningless, but rather doing important things to align with the vision and goal of your boss. 



**Communicate in the right way**. There two tyles of mangers: macro manager vs micro manager. Macro manager focus on the vision and people, while micro manager focus on the process. 

- Macro manager. Share with them the high-level vision and final impact of the projects, and share the issues of people. Keep it short (a few minutes) assuming that you only have 30 seconds to report in the elevator. Catch their attentions in your first few sentences: what is the problem, your proposed solution and expected result, and ask is it OK to proceed?

- Micro manager. Communicate in detail, show them the process, timetable, assigment, back up plans. Keep the meeting long (e.g., at least one hour). Usually, micro manager get nervous and stressed easily. You need to calm them with confidence. 

  

**Keep good relationship with secretary.** Always treat the secretary well. You can put you in a schedule when boss is in a good mood. 



## 3. Can Do Attitude

Don't be self-pity and complain. The common emotion for us is "懷才不遇". We feel bad about our situation,  questioning why is so unfair for someone less skillful than us to take a higher position. 

We need to be proactive. Always seek to solve the problems. 



## 4. Value Adding

It is a big lie for a company to advocate work-life balance. The biggest reason for a company to hire you is that you help the company to earn money. There are different types of adding value to company.
