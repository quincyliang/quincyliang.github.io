## 1. Industry Know How

As an employee, your first and foremost capability is **industry know how**, meaning that you have enough knowledge for this job,  market intelligence and industry networking. More importantly, you are able to keep up with the industry trend.

The biggest mistake for a company or an employee is not doing things wrong, but not doing the right things. Be careful and always ask am I heading in the right direction. For example, the strategy in marking industry 10 years ago is to shoot advertisement video by a super star. Nowadays, it is a totally different story. It turns to digital marketing and marketing campaign is switched to online social media and KOLs.

The lesson we learned from Nokia's case is that we need to keep us updated and be aware of the industry trend in the future. To improve ourselves, we can leverage the online courses.  



## 2. Ability to Manage Up

We need to manage our boss! 

**Align with your boss**. There are four big questions to ask:

- Do you know what is the goal of your boss?
- Do you know what "wins" your boss want?
- Are your priority and focus of your everyday work contribute to the goal of your boss?
- Do you share the same value as your boss?

Do not waste your time doing things meaningless, but rather doing important things to align with the vision and goal of your boss. 



**Communicate in the right way**. There two tyles of mangers: macro manager vs micro manager. Macro manager focus on the vision and people, while micro manager focus on the process. 

- **Macro manager**. Share with them the high-level vision and final impact of the projects, and share the issues of people. Keep it short (a few minutes) assuming that you only have 30 seconds to report in the elevator. Catch their attentions in your first few sentences: what is the problem, your proposed solution and expected result, and ask is it OK to proceed?

- **Micro manager**. Communicate in detail, show them the process, timetable, assigment, back up plans. Keep the meeting long (e.g., at least one hour). Usually, micro manager get nervous and stressed easily. You need to calm them with confidence. 

  

**Keep good relationship with secretary.** Always treat the secretary well. You can put you in a schedule when boss is in a good mood. 



## 3. Can Do Attitude

Don't be self-pity and complain. The common emotion for us is "懷才不遇". We feel bad about our situation,  questioning why is so unfair for someone less skillful than us to take a higher position. 

- We need to be proactive. 

- Always seek to solve problems. 

- Bring about new ideas. 



## 4. Value Adding

It is a big lie for a company to advocate work-life balance. The biggest reason for a company to hire you is that you help the company to earn money. There are different types of adding value to company.

- **Add revenue.** Develop new technoloy and new ideas. 
- **Reduce cost.** Opimize the implementation. 
- **Multiple value**. Promote company's branding.
- **Divide**.  Do more with less. Improve the efficiency of the team. 



## 5. Ask Questions - Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

## 9. What to do in a new job

Read the book [The First 90 Days](https://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-Expanded/dp/1422188612). There are some key points highlighted:

Here's a summary of the points from Amazon review:
- Establish your integrity in first 30 days.
- Learn all you can about the organization, put on your "historian" hat.
- **Don't suggest changes** without examining what has been done previously.
- Silence is not accession.
- **Meet with everyone** in the organization to evaluate their expectations. Ask them what they think you should focus on.
- Ask same questions of all so no one treated different and you have a cross-section.
- Look for "early wins," **low-hanging fruit** of improvements you can make or other things to boost morale.

**Dealing with your boss in the first 30 days:**
- Be proactive, assume it's on your shoulders to build the relationship and get the support you need.
- Schedule meetings to discuss **expectations, evaluations, and personal development**.
- Figure out what would give your boss "early wins." **Make his priorities your priorities**.
- Be proactive in doing things that will allow your boss to hear from people he trusts that you're a good worker.
- Don't bring your boss bad news early, at least without bringing good news too.
- Don't assume he will change. He has a style, foibles, accept them and work around then and move on. You can learn a lot from a bad boss, and you will likely have many.
- Examine how others relate to your boss and how he responds.

**Strategy**

- Begin figuring out who you need to move off your team immediately, whose roles need to change, and who you need to evaluate further.
- Think strategically. After your first 90 days you should be able to present a plan that is actionable.
- **Evaluate the vision of the organization, its values, and use SWOT analysis.**

**Ask yourself feedback questions every week.**

- What isn't going well. Why? What can you change?
- What are you least happy about. What can you change about it?
- What meeting troubled you the most? ""
- What conflict needs to be most resolved? ""
